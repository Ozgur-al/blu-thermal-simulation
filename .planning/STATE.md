# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Engineers can quickly set up a display stack, run thermal simulations, and get actionable results without programming knowledge or admin access — one-click launch, intuitive workflow.
**Current focus:** Milestone v2.0 — Phase 7: 3D Solver Core

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 9 (3D Solver Core)
Plan: 1 of 3 (07-01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — 07-01 regression safety net and MaterialZone model complete

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 11%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1 (v2.0)
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 0.23 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 07-3d-solver-core | 1 | 14 min | 14 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Per-cell materials is the harder architectural change; z-refinement is trivial once per-cell works (drives Phase 7 before Phase 8)
- NodeLayout abstraction must be centralized before any z-refinement code — silently wrong otherwise
- Backward-compat regression test is the Phase 7 entry gate — write before touching any builder code
- Structured Cartesian grid only — no unstructured/tetrahedral mesh
- Vectorized NumPy conductance assembly required — no Python loops per cell in builder hot path
- DLED.json mesh: 450x300 causes UMFPACK OOM segfault in transient solve (1.08M nodes); reduced to 64x24 for regression baselines
- Layer.to_dict() omits 'zones' key entirely when zones=[] to preserve old JSON round-trip fidelity
- MaterialZone follows Material frozen dataclass pattern: __post_init__ validation + to_dict/from_dict

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 ELED preset: verify that Phase 6 ELED stack template exposes frame width, LED board width, and air gap width as named fields before committing to preset implementation approach (one-file inspection at Phase 9 planning start)
- CSV export format versioning: adding z-slice index to exports will break existing CSV readers — plan a format version bump before Phase 8 is declared complete
