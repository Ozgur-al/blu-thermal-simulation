# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: MainWindow refactor must precede all new GUI features — 939-line god object is the top structural risk
- [Init]: Backend engines (sweep, power profile, PDF) built CLI-first before GUI wiring
- [Init]: PyInstaller --onedir only (never --onefile) — AV quarantine risk on managed Windows machines
- [Init]: reportlab + qt-material + pyinstaller + pyinstaller-hooks-contrib are the only four new dependencies

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Sweep memory — estimate ~350 MB for 10-run transient sweep; validate with tracemalloc early in Phase 3 before it becomes an emergency
- [Phase 5]: Corporate AV behavior beyond Defender (CrowdStrike, Cylance) not verified — needs real test on a target machine
