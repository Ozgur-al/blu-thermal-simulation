# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Engineers can quickly set up a display stack, run thermal simulations, and get actionable results without programming knowledge or admin access — one-click launch, intuitive workflow.
**Current focus:** Milestone v2.0 — Phase 7: 3D Solver Core

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 9 (3D Solver Core)
Plan: — of TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — v2.0 roadmap created (Phases 7-9)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0 (v2.0)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Per-cell materials is the harder architectural change; z-refinement is trivial once per-cell works (drives Phase 7 before Phase 8)
- NodeLayout abstraction must be centralized before any z-refinement code — silently wrong otherwise
- Backward-compat regression test is the Phase 7 entry gate — write before touching any builder code
- Structured Cartesian grid only — no unstructured/tetrahedral mesh
- Vectorized NumPy conductance assembly required — no Python loops per cell in builder hot path

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 ELED preset: verify that Phase 6 ELED stack template exposes frame width, LED board width, and air gap width as named fields before committing to preset implementation approach (one-file inspection at Phase 9 planning start)
- CSV export format versioning: adding z-slice index to exports will break existing CSV readers — plan a format version bump before Phase 8 is declared complete
